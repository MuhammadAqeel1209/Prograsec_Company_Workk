      "1. **The longest cricket match in history lasted 12 days and still ended in a draw:**  This epic test match between England and South Africa in Durban (1939) was abandoned due to the England team having to catch their ship home.  Imagine playing for almost two weeks and not having a winner!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cricket was once an Olympic sport:**  Believe it or not, cricket was featured in the 1900 Paris Olympics.  Only Great Britain and France participated, and Great Britain took home the gold.  It hasn't been included since.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **The bails have to weigh less than a certain amount:**  The two small pieces of wood balanced on the stumps, known as bails, have a maximum weight limit.  They must weigh between 4.94 oz and 5.3 oz (140g and 151g). This seemingly minor detail ensures they are light enough to be dislodged when the wicket is hit.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **A cricket ball has been hit over the roof of the Lord's Cricket Ground:**  This feat has only been achieved a handful of times, making it a truly rare and impressive accomplishment.  Hitting a six out of the ground is one thing, but clearing the roof of the \"Home of Cricket\" is legendary.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **\"It's just not cricket\" signifies fair play:**  The phrase \"It's just not cricket\" has transcended the sport itself and is used in everyday language to describe unfair or unsporting behavior.  This speaks to the historical association of cricket with sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct.\n"
